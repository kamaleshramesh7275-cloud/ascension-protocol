# Life Architect Quest System

## Overview
The Life Architect system generates personalized quests aligned with your real-life goals, not just fitness. It transforms your daily tasks into an RPG-style progression system.

## How It Works

### 1. Goal Selection
When you first log in (or if you haven't set a goal), you'll see a dialog asking you to "Choose Your Path":

**Five Pillars:**
- 🏋️ **Fitness** - Strength, Endurance, Health
- 🧠 **Intellect** - Learning, Skills, Reading  
- 💼 **Wealth** - Career, Business, Finance
- 👥 **Social** - Charisma, Networking, Relationships
- ✨ **Mindfulness** - Meditation, Mental Health, Willpower

**Your North Star:**
After selecting a pillar, you define your specific goal:
- Fitness: "Run a marathon", "Bench press 100kg"
- Intellect: "Learn Python", "Read 12 books this year"
- Wealth: "Launch a side hustle", "Save $10k"
- Social: "Make 5 new friends", "Speak at an event"
- Mindfulness: "Meditate daily", "Quit smoking"

### 2. Personalized Quest Generation
Every day, the system generates 3 quests tailored to your goal:

**Primary Quest** - Directly aligned with your goal
- If goal is "Learn Python": "Deep Work: Learn Python - Spend 45 minutes focused solely on Learn Python. No distractions."
- Rewards: 100 XP, 20 Coins, +2 Intelligence, +1 Willpower

**Habit Quest** - Supporting healthy habits
- "Hydration Check - Drink 3 liters of water today"
- Rewards: 50 XP, 10 Coins, +1 Vitality

**Challenge Quest** - Push your comfort zone
- "The Extra Mile - Do one thing today that scares you or is uncomfortable"
- Rewards: 150 XP, 50 Coins, +3 Willpower

### 3. Progressive Difficulty (Fitness Example)
For fitness goals, the system uses your assessment data:
- If you entered "10 pushups" during registration
- Your quest will be: "Push Limit: 12 Pushups - Do 12 pushups in a single set. Beat your previous record of 10."
- This creates progressive overload automatically

### 4. Stat Alignment
Quests reward stats that match your focus:
- **Intellect** quests → Intelligence + Willpower
- **Wealth** quests → Intelligence + Charisma  
- **Social** quests → Charisma
- **Mindfulness** quests → Willpower + Vitality
- **Fitness** quests → Strength/Agility/Stamina

## Current Focus Display
Your dashboard now shows your current focus as a badge:
```
🎯 Current Focus: Learn Python
```

## Changing Your Goal
You can update your goal anytime by:
1. Going to your profile settings
2. Or clicking "Change Goal" in the dashboard (future feature)

## What's Next
